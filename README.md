# Swagger 2 (SpringFox) with Spring Boot 2.x.x version
This project is a simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates how to use Swagger 2 for documenting a Spring REST API.
Using the Springfox implementation of the Swagger 2 specification.

# Prerequisites
* Java Development Kit (JDK) 17
* Apache Maven 3.6.3
* Lombok plugin installed in IDE


# Verification
To verify that Springfox is working, we can visit this URL in our browser:
- swagger api-doc : http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs
- swaggerUI : http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/#/

# Things Covered in this project
* Swagger 2 integration with Spring Boot using springfox-boot-starter
* Swagger 2 working with Spring Data REST 
* Swagger 2 working with Bean Validations
* Bean Validations
* Filtering API for Swagger’s Response
* Adding Custom API specification

> **Learning Notes**:
>* Springfox provides support for Spring Data REST through its `springfox-data-rest` library.
<br> To enable this we need to add the `springfox-data-rest` dependency to our project and import the 
`SpringDataRestConfiguration` class to the SpringFoxConfig class.
<br><br>
>* Springfox also supports the bean validation annotations through its `springfox-bean-validators` library.
<br>To enable this we need to add the `springfox-bean-validators` dependency to our project and import 
the `BeanValidatorPluginsConfiguration` class to the SpringFoxConfig class:
<br><br>
>* We can restrict Swagger’s response by passing parameters to the apis() and paths() methods of the Docket class.
<br><br>
>*  `springfox-boot-starter` is a new starter module that includes all the necessary dependencies to enable Swagger in a 
Spring Boot application.
>>* if You are using` springfox-boot-starter` dependency, you don't need to add springfox-data-rest, springfox-bean-validators 
or any other springfox dependencies explicitly, it's already included in the springfox-boot-starter dependency.
>>
>>* if you are using `springfox-boot-starter` dependency, you don't need to add exclusive imports like SpringDataRestConfiguration, 
 BeanValidatorPluginsConfiguration are not needed
